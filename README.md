# GenAI Bootcamp: Production

# Getting Started

Please follow the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) to get your machine configured.

# Opening code

Because this is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), VS Code/Cursor and the like can be
slow to load, because it needs to run checks on the Python code for every single project.

Instead, load only the code for the task you're working on by navigating to `File -> Open Workspace from File...`
and selecting the workspace file (eg `week5/1-hello-world/1-hello-world.code-workspace`).
